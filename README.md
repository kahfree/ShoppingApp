# ShoppingApp

## General Overview
Final project of 1st year for Object Oriented Programming in C++. Focuses on the instantiating of objects with array-type.

This app also incorporates a login function reading from a .txt file. These .txt files could be updated with new information
provided you were a Manager ('m') and not an Assistant ('a'). The manager and assistant were both displayed different screens
so a manager would have more functionality than an assistant.

### The Login Feature
